# Successfully Migrating a Server Room Behind CG-NAT Using WireGuard and HAProxy

Last week, I executed a significant server room transfer for one of my client. Moving their servers to a new location, presented unique challenges due to the new site's placement behind CG-NAT (Carrier Grade Network Address Translation), so no public IP. Here's how I tackled and overcame these challenges using WireGuard for secure tunneling and HAProxy for SMTP traffic management.

## The Challenge

Transferring server rooms is a daunting task in itself. The client's new location, operating behind CG-NAT, added layers of complexity. CG-NAT often complicates direct access to internal services like OpenVPN and SMTP. To overcome this, I devised a solution to route traffic effectively using WireGuard for secure tunneling and HAProxy for efficient load balancing and proxying of SMTP traffic.

## The Solution

I set up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to terminate a WireGuard tunnel, allowing me to route traffic through this secure tunnel to the client's internal network services. Additionally, I configured HAProxy to manage SMTP traffic effectively.

## Network Layer Description

Before diving into the technical details, let's visualize the network layer involved in this setup:

```plaintext
Internet --> VPS --> WireGuard Tunnel --> pfSense
```

For mail, there is a Proxmox Mail Gateway on the local network, which handles SMTP traffic:

```plaintext
Internet --> VPS --> WireGuard Tunnel --> pfSense --> Proxmox Mail Gateway
```

### WireGuard Configuration

Below is the WireGuard configuration setup for routing OpenVPN traffic through the secure tunnel at the default port 1194:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <YourPrivateKey>
Address = 10.69.69.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

# OpenVPN certificate-based connection
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.69.69.5:1194
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j SNAT --to-source 10.69.69.1
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

# Cleanup rules on interface down
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.69.69.5:1194
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j SNAT --to-source 10.69.69.1
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

[Peer]
PublicKey = <NewDC_PublicKey>
AllowedIPs = 10.69.69.5/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### Explanation of Configuration

Let's break down some of the key settings in this configuration:

- **ListenPort = 51820**: This is the port on which WireGuard listens for incoming connections. The default port is 51820.
- **PostUp and PostDown rules**: These `iptables` rules are essential for routing traffic correctly when the WireGuard interface comes up or goes down.

  - **PostUp**: The `PostUp` commands are executed when the WireGuard interface is brought up. In this case, they are used to set up `iptables` rules to direct OpenVPN traffic to the internal server.
    - `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.69.69.5:1194`: This line adds a rule to the `nat` table that changes the destination IP address of packets coming into the VPS on UDP port 1194 to the internal server's IP address (10.69.69.5).
    - `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j SNAT --to-source 10.69.69.1`: This rule ensures that the internal server sees the packets as coming from the WireGuard server's internal IP (10.69.69.1), rather than the original external IP.
    - `iptables -A FORWARD -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT`: This rule allows the forwarding of OpenVPN traffic to the internal server.

  - **PostDown**: The `PostDown` commands are executed when the WireGuard interface is brought down. They remove the `iptables` rules added by the `PostUp` commands to ensure the system is left clean.
    - `iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.69.69.5:1194`: This deletes the rule that redirected OpenVPN traffic to the internal server.
    - `iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j SNAT --to-source 10.69.69.1`: This deletes the rule that rewrote the source address of the forwarded traffic.
    - `iptables -D FORWARD -p udp -d 10.69.69.5 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT`: This removes the forwarding rule for OpenVPN traffic.

- **PersistentKeepalive = 25**: This setting ensures that the WireGuard tunnel remains active even if there is no traffic, preventing the connection from timing out in environments with NAT.

### HAProxy Configuration

I used HAProxy to handle SMTP traffic efficiently. Below is the configuration for HAProxy:

```ini
global
    maxconn 2000
    stats socket /tmp/haproxy.socket level admin expose-fd listeners
    uid 80
    gid 80
    nbthread 2
    hard-stop-after 15m
    chroot /tmp/haproxy_chroot
    daemon
    server-state-file /tmp/haproxy_server_state
    log /dev/log local0 info
    tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048

defaults
    log global
    mode tcp
    option dontlognull
    option tcplog
    retries 3
    timeout connect 10s
    timeout client 30s
    timeout server 30s
    timeout queue 30s
    timeout check 5s

frontend email_smtp
    bind *:25 name smtp
    mode tcp
    log global
    timeout client 30000
    option tcplog
    default_backend emailPMG

backend emailPMG
    mode tcp
    id 102
    log global
    option tcp-check
    retries 3
    load-server-state-from-file global
    server pmgmailserver 10.69.69.5:25 id 101 send-proxy
```

### Explanation of HAProxy Configuration

- **global section**: 
  - `maxconn 2000`: Limits the maximum number of concurrent connections.
  - `stats socket /tmp/haproxy.socket level admin expose-fd listeners`: Configures a stats socket for administrative tasks.
  - `chroot /tmp/haproxy_chroot`: Changes the root directory to increase security.
  - `daemon`: Runs HAProxy as a background service.
  - `log /dev/log local0 info`: Configures logging to the syslog.

- **defaults section**: 
  - `mode tcp`: Sets the mode to TCP for handling raw TCP sessions.
  - `timeout connect 10s`, `timeout client 30s`, and `timeout server 30s`: Sets various timeout values to ensure the timely handling of connections.

- **frontend section**: 
  - `bind *:25 name smtp`: Binds to port 25 for incoming SMTP traffic.
  - `default_backend emailPMG`: Specifies the backend to which SMTP traffic should be forwarded.

- **backend section**: 
  - `server pmgmailserver 10.69.69.5:25 id 101 send-proxy`: Defines the backend server where SMTP traffic will be sent. The `send-proxy` option is used to send the original clientâ€™s IP address to the backend server.

### Additional Setup for Proxmox Mail Gateway
To ensure that the Proxmox Mail Gateway can correctly handle the traffic being proxied by HAProxy, additional setup is required:
```sh
mkdir /etc/pmg/templates
cp /var/lib/pmg/templates/main.cf.in /etc/pmg/templates/original_main.cf.in
echo '[% INCLUDE original_main.cf.in %]'            >  /etc/pmg/templates/main.cf.in
echo '# find me in /etc/pmg/templates/main.cf.in'   >> /etc/pmg/templates/main.cf.in
echo 'postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol = haproxy' >> /etc/pmg/templates/main.cf.in
pmgconfig sync --restart 1
```
This setup involves:

Creating a custom templates directory: This prevents overwriting the default configuration files during updates.
Copying the existing configuration: By copying the original main.cf.in to the custom directory, any changes are preserved.
Modifying the configuration: Add the necessary configuration for HAProxy by including the original configuration and appending the required Proxy Protocol settings.
Syncing the configuration: Apply changes and restart the necessary services.


### Ansible Playbook for Automation

To streamline the deployment, I used an Ansible playbook:

```yaml

```

## Conclusion

By configuring WireGuard and HAProxy, I effectively navigated the challenges posed by CG-NAT at the new server location. This setup ensures secure and reliable access to the client's internal services, streamlining their operations while maintaining robust security protocols.
